# Live ASCII Arts
This repository contains a collection of live ASCII Animated Arts that can be displayed in your terminal.

# Usage
To see the list of available ASCII art frames, run the following command:
```bash
curl educatedsmp.is-a.dev/rocket | bash
```

# Compile.sh
This gets frames from txt files, 0.txt to 9.txt respectively and saves a output file called output.sh that can be executed to animate the frames
